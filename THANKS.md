# Thanks

The Switchmode Developer Agreement can only improve and succeed with the help of community members---lawyers, coders, and businessfolk---who take time to share their thoughts and experiences.

This file is for special thanks to contributors who are comfortable being mentioned publicly.  Especially for those whose vital contributions didn't necessarily take the form of commits to the repository.

For several superb GitHub issues pointing out typos, awkward wording, and structural errors, and for sharing relevant contracting experience.
